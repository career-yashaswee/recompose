# Email Verification with 6-Digit OTP Implementation

This document describes the implementation of email verification functionality using 6-digit OTP codes for new user sign-ups.

## Overview

The email verification flow has been implemented using:

- **Better Auth** for authentication and email verification logic
- **Resend** for sending verification emails with OTP codes
- **React** components for the frontend UI
- **6-digit OTP** codes for secure email verification

## Implementation Details

### 1. Email Verification Service (`lib/email-service.ts`)

Added `sendEmailVerification` function that:

- Sends professional HTML emails with 6-digit OTP codes
- Includes plain text fallback
- Provides clear instructions for users
- Has security warnings and expiration notices

### 2. Better Auth Configuration (`lib/auth.ts`)

Updated configuration to:

- Disable auto sign-in (`autoSignIn: false`)
- Send verification emails with OTP codes
- Generate 6-digit OTP from verification tokens
- Handle email verification flow

### 3. Email Verification Page (`app/(auth)/verify-email/page.tsx`)

New page that provides:

- 6-digit OTP input with validation
- Real-time code formatting
- Resend verification code functionality
- Success state with auto-redirect
- Error handling and user feedback

### 4. Sign-up Page Updates (`app/(auth)/sign-up/page.tsx`)

Enhanced sign-up flow with:

- Password confirmation field
- Password strength validation
- Success message with redirect to verification
- Improved error handling and UX

### 5. API Endpoints

#### `/api/auth/verify-email` (POST)

- Validates 6-digit OTP codes
- Verifies email using Better Auth
- Returns success/error responses

#### `/api/auth/resend-verification` (POST)

- Resends verification emails
- Generates new OTP codes
- Handles rate limiting and errors

### 6. Auth Client Updates (`lib/auth-client.ts`)

Added functions for:

- Email verification with OTP
- Resending verification emails
- Error handling and user feedback

## Features

### Email Template

- Professional HTML design with branding
- Large, clearly visible 6-digit OTP code
- Step-by-step instructions
- Security warnings and expiration notices
- Responsive design with dark mode support

### OTP Generation

- Cryptographically secure 6-digit codes
- Generated from verification tokens using SHA-256
- Consistent across email and verification
- 10-minute expiration for security

### User Experience

- Real-time OTP input validation
- Auto-formatting of 6-digit codes
- Loading states and progress indicators
- Clear error messages and success confirmations
- Resend functionality for missed emails

### Security

- Token-based verification system
- OTP expiration after 10 minutes
- Secure code generation using crypto
- No sensitive data in URLs or client-side storage

## User Flow

### 1. Sign-up Process

1. User fills out sign-up form with name, email, and password
2. Password validation ensures strength requirements
3. Account is created but email is not verified
4. Verification email is sent automatically
5. User is redirected to verification page

### 2. Email Verification

1. User receives email with 6-digit OTP code
2. User navigates to verification page
3. User enters the 6-digit code
4. System validates the code against the token
5. Email is verified and user can log in

### 3. Resend Functionality

1. If user doesn't receive email, they can click "Resend code"
2. New verification email is sent with fresh OTP
3. Previous OTP codes become invalid
4. User can try verification again

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
# Resend Email Service (required)
RESEND_API_KEY="re_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL="noreply@yourdomain.com"

# Better Auth (required)
BETTER_AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"
```

### Better Auth Settings

- `autoSignIn: false` - Requires email verification before login
- `sendVerificationEmail` - Custom function for OTP emails
- `minPasswordLength: 8` - Strong password requirements

## Testing

### Local Development

1. Set up environment variables
2. Start development server
3. Navigate to `/sign-up`
4. Create account with valid email
5. Check email for verification code
6. Enter code on verification page
7. Verify successful email verification

### Production Testing

1. Deploy with proper environment variables
2. Test with real email addresses
3. Verify email delivery and formatting
4. Test OTP validation and expiration
5. Test resend functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Verification emails not sending**
   - Check RESEND_API_KEY is correct
   - Verify RESEND_FROM_EMAIL is set
   - Ensure domain is verified in Resend

2. **OTP codes not working**
   - Check token generation and validation
   - Verify OTP generation algorithm
   - Check for timing issues or expiration

3. **Verification page not loading**
   - Check URL parameters (token, email)
   - Verify API endpoints are working
   - Check for JavaScript errors

4. **Better Auth integration issues**
   - Verify Better Auth configuration
   - Check database schema compatibility
   - Ensure proper error handling

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by adding to environment:

```env
DEBUG=better-auth:*
```

## Security Considerations

1. **OTP Security**
   - Codes are cryptographically secure
   - 10-minute expiration prevents abuse
   - No client-side storage of sensitive data

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Consider implementing rate limiting for resend requests
   - Monitor for abuse patterns
   - Implement CAPTCHA for suspicious activity

3. **Email Security**
   - Use verified sending domains
   - Implement SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
   - Monitor email delivery rates

4. **Database Security**
   - Verification tokens are stored securely
   - Proper cleanup of expired tokens
   - No sensitive data in logs

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1. **SMS Verification**
   - Add SMS OTP as alternative to email
   - Multi-factor authentication options
   - Backup verification methods

2. **Advanced Security**
   - Device fingerprinting
   - IP-based rate limiting
   - Suspicious activity detection

3. **User Experience**
   - Auto-detection of OTP from SMS
   - Biometric verification options
   - Social login integration

4. **Analytics**
   - Verification completion rates
   - Email delivery metrics
   - User behavior tracking
