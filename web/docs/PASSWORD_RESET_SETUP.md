# Password Reset Implementation with Resend

This document describes the implementation of the password reset functionality using Resend email service.

## Overview

The password reset flow has been implemented using:

- **Better Auth** for authentication and password reset logic
- **Resend** for sending password reset emails
- **React** components for the frontend UI

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

The Resend package has been installed:

```bash
npm install resend --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Add the following environment variables to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Resend Email Service
RESEND_API_KEY="re_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL="noreply@yourdomain.com"

# Better Auth (if not already configured)
BETTER_AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"
```

### 3. Resend Account Setup

1. Sign up for a Resend account at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Create an API key in your Resend dashboard
3. Add and verify your domain in Resend
4. Set up your sending email address

### 4. Domain Verification

For production, you need to:

1. Add your domain to Resend
2. Add the required DNS records
3. Verify the domain
4. Update `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` to use your verified domain

## Implementation Details

### Email Service (`lib/email-service.ts`)

The email service provides:

- HTML email templates for password reset
- Plain text fallback
- Error handling and validation
- TypeScript types for safety

### Auth Configuration (`lib/auth.ts`)

Better Auth is configured to:

- Use the Resend email service for password reset emails
- Handle password reset tokens and validation
- Integrate with the existing Prisma database

### Frontend Components

#### Forget Password Page (`app/(auth)/forget-password/page.tsx`)

- Email input with validation
- Success state with instructions
- Error handling and retry functionality
- Responsive design with dark mode support

#### Reset Password Page (`app/(auth)/reset-password/page.tsx`)

- Password and confirm password inputs
- Password strength validation
- Success state with redirect
- Token validation and error handling

## Features

### Email Template

- Professional HTML design
- Responsive layout
- Dark mode support
- Security warnings
- Clear call-to-action buttons
- Plain text fallback

### Password Validation

- Minimum 8 characters
- Uppercase letter required
- Lowercase letter required
- Number required
- Real-time validation feedback

### User Experience

- Loading states with spinners
- Clear error messages
- Success confirmations
- Auto-redirect after success
- Retry functionality
- Responsive design

### Security

- Token-based reset links
- 1-hour expiration
- Secure password requirements
- No sensitive data in URLs

## Testing

### Local Development

1. Set up environment variables
2. Start the development server
3. Navigate to `/forget-password`
4. Enter a valid email address
5. Check your email for the reset link
6. Follow the link to reset your password

### Production Testing

1. Deploy with proper environment variables
2. Test with real email addresses
3. Verify email delivery
4. Test password reset flow end-to-end

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Email not sending**
   - Check RESEND_API_KEY is correct
   - Verify RESEND_FROM_EMAIL is set
   - Ensure domain is verified in Resend

2. **Reset link not working**
   - Check BETTER_AUTH_URL is correct
   - Verify token hasn't expired (1 hour)
   - Check for typos in the reset URL

3. **Password validation errors**
   - Ensure password meets all requirements
   - Check for special characters that might cause issues
   - Verify password and confirm password match

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by adding to your environment:

```env
DEBUG=better-auth:*
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for password reset requests
2. **Email Validation**: The system doesn't reveal if an email exists in the database
3. **Token Security**: Reset tokens are cryptographically secure and time-limited
4. **Password Strength**: Enforced password requirements for security

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1. Email templates with React Email
2. Rate limiting for reset requests
3. Audit logging for password resets
4. Multiple email template options
5. Internationalization support
6. Email delivery tracking
