# Badge System Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive badge system has been implemented for the Recompose platform that tracks user achievements and provides gamification elements. The system includes database models, API routes, React components, and automatic tracking logic.

## Database Schema

### Models Added
1. **Badge** - Defines badge templates with criteria and metadata
2. **UserBadge** - Tracks individual user progress and achievements
3. **Enums**: `BadgeTier` (BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD, PLATINUM), `BadgeCategory` (COMPOSITION, ENGAGEMENT, STREAK, ACHIEVEMENT)

### Key Features
- Flexible criteria system using JSON for different badge types
- Progress tracking per user per badge
- Support for different badge tiers and categories
- Automatic badge earning detection

## API Routes

### `/api/badges`
- `GET` - Fetch all badges with user progress
- `POST` - Create new badge (admin)

### `/api/badges/[id]`
- `GET` - Fetch specific badge with user progress
- `PUT` - Update badge (admin)
- `DELETE` - Delete badge (admin)

### `/api/badges/user-progress`
- `GET` - Get user's badge progress summary and statistics

## React Components

### Core Components
1. **BadgeCard** - Individual badge display with progress
2. **BadgeGrid** - Grid layout for multiple badges
3. **BadgeStats** - Progress statistics and category breakdown
4. **BadgeNotification** - Real-time badge earning notifications

### Features
- Visual distinction between earned and locked badges
- Progress bars and completion percentages
- Tier-based styling (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum)
- Category organization
- Download functionality for earned badges

## Badge Tracking Logic

### Automatic Tracking
The system automatically tracks:
1. **Composition Completion** - When users mark compositions as solved
2. **Composition Liking** - When users like compositions (only new likes, not updates)

### Integration Points
- `app/api/compositions/progress/route.ts` - Tracks completion
- `app/api/compositions/reaction/route.ts` - Tracks likes
- `lib/badge-system.ts` - Core tracking logic

## Default Badges

### Badge 1: Composition Starter
- **Criteria**: Complete 5 compositions
- **Tier**: Bronze
- **Category**: Composition
- **Icon**: üéØ

### Badge 2: Composition Lover
- **Criteria**: Like 5 compositions
- **Tier**: Bronze
- **Category**: Engagement
- **Icon**: ‚ù§Ô∏è

## User Interface

### Badges Page (`/stage/badges`)
- Complete badge collection view
- Filtering by category, tier, and status
- Progress statistics and recent achievements
- Category-based organization

### Navigation Integration
- Added "Badges" link to main navigation
- Trophy icon for easy identification

### Real-time Notifications
- Toast notifications when badges are earned
- Auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
- Link to view full badge collection

## React Hooks

### `useBadges()`
- Fetch all badges with user progress
- Caching and error handling
- Optimistic updates

### `useBadgeProgress()`
- Get user's overall badge statistics
- Category breakdowns
- Recent achievements

### Admin Hooks
- `useCreateBadge()` - Create new badges
- `useUpdateBadge()` - Update existing badges
- `useDeleteBadge()` - Remove badges

## Database Migration

### Migration File
- `prisma/migrations/20250103000000_init_badges/migration.sql`
- Creates tables, indexes, and default badges
- Includes foreign key constraints

### Initialization Script
- `scripts/init-badges.ts` - Sets up default badges
- Can be run independently for development

## Key Features

### Personalization
- Each user has individual badge progress
- Progress persists across sessions
- Real-time updates when activities occur

### Gamification
- Visual progress indicators
- Achievement notifications
- Tier-based rewards system
- Category organization for different activity types

### Extensibility
- Easy to add new badge types
- Flexible criteria system
- Support for different tracking mechanisms
- Admin interface for badge management

## Usage Examples

### Checking Badge Progress
```typescript
const { data: badges } = useBadges();
const { data: progress } = useBadgeProgress();
```

### Adding New Badge Tracking
```typescript
await updateBadgeProgress(userId, 'new_activity_type', 1);
```

### Creating Custom Badges
```typescript
const createBadge = useCreateBadge();
await createBadge.mutateAsync({
  name: 'Custom Badge',
  description: 'Complete a custom activity',
  criteria: { type: 'custom_activity', count: 10 },
  category: 'ACHIEVEMENT',
  tier: 'GOLD'
});
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Streak Badges** - Daily/weekly/monthly streaks
2. **Points-based Badges** - Based on total points earned
3. **Social Badges** - Sharing achievements
4. **Badge Collections** - Grouped badge sets
5. **Badge Challenges** - Time-limited achievements
6. **Badge Leaderboards** - Compare with other users

### Technical Improvements
1. **Badge Analytics** - Track badge earning patterns
2. **Badge Recommendations** - Suggest next badges to earn
3. **Badge Export** - Download badge certificates
4. **Badge Sharing** - Social media integration
5. **Badge Animation** - Enhanced visual feedback

## Conclusion

The badge system provides a solid foundation for gamification on the Recompose platform. It's designed to be extensible, user-friendly, and performant. The implementation follows TypeScript best practices and integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase architecture.
